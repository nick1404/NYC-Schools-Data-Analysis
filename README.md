# NYC-Schools-Data-Analysis

The data from this project is inspired by a similar one from [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/m/217-guided-project-analyzing-nyc-high-school-data/).

The main objective of the analysis was to investigate the **gender and racial differences in SAT scores** between schools in New York City and investigate **the differences between students', teachers' and parents' opinions** on academic standards and safety in their school.
Additionally, a correlation between AP test takers and SAT scores was tested. 

I have used **Jupyter Notebooks** and the following **Python libraries**: pandas, matplotlib and numpy.

The NYC schools data was loaded from a couple of files:
- **ap_2010.csv** - AP test takers data in 2010
- **class_size.csv** - Class sizes
- **demographics.csv** - Ethnic backgrounds of students per grade
- **graduation.csv** - Numbers of students that have graduated or dropped out 
- **hs_directory.csv** - A directory of high schools
- **sat_results.csv** - SAT average score per school for different subjects
- **survey_d75.txt** & **survey_all.txt** - Survey of students', parents' and teachers' perceptions of their school's academic standards, safety etc. A dictionary of data in these files can be found in **Survey_Data_Dictionary.csv**.
